# Network Intrusion Detection using Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview
This project focuses on **network intrusion detection** using the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**. The primary goal is to classify network traffic as either **normal or an attack** by implementing a **Decision Tree Classifier**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **GridSearchCV** (for hyperparameter tuning)
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** (for advanced optimization)

## Key Features
### 1. **Feature Engineering**
- One-hot encoding for categorical data
- Feature selection for improved model performance

### 2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- **GridSearchCV**: Exhaustive hyperparameter tuning
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Metaheuristic approach to refine parameters

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification reports

## Results & Insights
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in **Machine Learning**, **feature engineering**, and **hyperparameter tuning**. The use of **PSO** provided an insightful comparison to traditional methods, demonstrating the potential of metaheuristic approaches in ML.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saidililia/Swarm-Optimization.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```sh

   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, CNNs) for better performance.
- Experiment with additional feature selection techniques.
